# parse and convert Federal Register XML into Markdown

# 2. Schema Description
#
# The schema chosen to represent the Federal Register is a simplified version of
# the SGML schema that is used as part of the print production process, with
# some presentation and print specific tags removed or collapsed, and then
# converted to well-formed XML. This schema was chosen for the following
# reasons:
#
# 1. It is a complete and faithful representation of the Federal Register, which
# matches most closely to the author's original intent.
# 2. It describes the data using semantic tags in a way that is appropriate to
# the Federal Register Domain. For example, <RULE>, <NOTICE>, and <AGENCY> are
# all tags in this schema.
# 3. It fully describes the structure of the Federal Register, including the
# large structure (parts, articles, corrections, table of contents, etc.), the
# document structure (titles, paragraphs, sections, etc.), and semantic
# structure (CFR references, agency names, contact information, amendment text,
# etc.)
#
# Since the schema is not an authoring schema and the SGML to XML conversion
# process maintains the order of the tags, this allows the XML schema to be more
# permissive than if it were used for checking authored content.
#
# The schema being produced for this effort describes the data as it actually
# occurs from the OFR. Documents are not being cleaned up because they do not
# match the schema; instead, the schema was selectively relaxed. Such an
# approach maintains 100% fidelity to the original data, and eliminates any
# errors that might occur in schema interpretation or further data manipulation.
#
# The following table lists the SGML tags that were removed or collapsed into a
# source attribute in the Federal Register XML.
#

#
# ## 2.2. Sections, Parts, and Articles
#
# This section describes the top-level structure of a Federal Register XML file.
#
# The XML schema, being a translated reproduction of the SGML schema, contains
# tags and content in the same order as they appear in the printed document.
# Major sections are grouped appropriately (<CNTNTS>, <RULES>, <PRORULES>,
# <NOTICES>, <NEWPART>, <CORRECT>), and all data and tags are represented – with
# the exception of the reduced tags from the previous section.
#
# The XML tags and their descriptions of the schema above are shown below:
#
# | XML Tag | Description |
# | --- | --- |
# | FEDREG | The root tag for all document types in Federal Register publications.  This tag includes children such as CNTNTS, RULES, PRORULES, NOTICES, NEWPART.   |
# | VOL | Contains the volume number for the publication. |
# | NO | Contains the issue number of the volume. |
# | UNITNAME | Contains the display name of the unit which follows, for example, "Notices", "Proposed Rules", "Rules", and "Presidential Documents". |
# | CNTNTS | Contains table of contents pages for the Federal Register. |
# | RULES | Used to start Rules section of the federal register. RULES may contain at least one <RULE>. |
# | RULE | Used to start individual Rules in the Rules section. |
# | PRORULES | Used to start Proposed Rules section of the Federal Register. Should contain at least one <PRORULE>. |
# | PRORULE | Used to start individual Proposed Rule of the Federal Register. |
# | NOTICES | Starts Notices section of the Federal Register. Should contain at least one <NOTICE>. |
# | NOTICE | Start individual Notice within Notices section. |
#
# An abbreviated example of the overall section and structure is below:
#
# ```
# <FEDREG>
#
#   <VOL>65</VOL>
#   <NO>21</NO>
#   <UNITNAME>Contents</UNITNAME>
#   <CNTNTS>
#     ... THE CONTENTS OF THE TABLE OF CONTENTS ...
#   </CNTNTS>
#   <DATE>Tuesday, February 1, 2000 1-3-00</DATE>
#   <UNITNAME>Rules and Regulations</UNITNAME>
#   <RULES>
#     <RULE>  ... THE CONTENTS OF THE RULE ... </RULE>

#   <UNITNAME>Proposed Rules</UNITNAME>
#   <PRORULES>
#     <PRORULE>  ... THE CONTENTS OF THE PROPOSED RULE ... </PRORULE>

#
## 2.7. Presidential Documents
#
# The PRESDOCS tag must have one or more presidential documents which may
# include determinations, executive orders, memos, notices, or proclamations. A
# presidential notice, for example, will often have a title and presidential
# signature associated with it. It may also include the place of issuance which
# is usually "The White House." These items are always followed by Federal
# Register doc number, the date filed, and the billing code.
#
# The XML tags and their descriptions of the schema above are shown below:
#
# | Node | Description |
# | --- | --- |
# | PRESDOCS | Used to start presidential documents section of the Federal Register. |
# | PRESDOCU | Used to start individual Presidential document in the Federal Register. |
# | PRESDOC | Used to start individual Presidential documents section of the Federal Register. |
# | PRNOTICE | Notice of the Presidential documents. |
# | DETERM | Presidential determination in Presidential documents. |
# | EXECORD | Presidential Executive Order in Presidential documents. |
